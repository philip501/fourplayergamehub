The goal of this track is to avoid the obstacles coming your way. This can be done by moving your ship left and right by pressing your left and right button respectively. Pressing a button will result in the ship to move to the next left of right edge depending on which button was pressed. In case a ship is already on the given edge or is currently moving to this edge you cannot move there. The last player 'alive' will be awarded a point.
