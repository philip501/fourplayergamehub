The goal of this game is to press the button whenever the inequality according to either the population or area of the two countries holds true. The fastest one to do so will be awarded a point and your button will be highlighted in green. In case a button is pressed and the inequality does not hold true you will lose a point and your button will be highlighted in red (as can be seen in the picture above).

In the example above the task was to press the button when the inequality holds true for the population of the two countries. When a button is pressed the result will be revealed, meaning that the name of the country will be replaced by number of either its population or its area depending on what was sepcified prior to the game.

By default you have four seconds to recognise whether the inequality holds true. This and other parameters (see list of customisable parameters below) can be customised.

Prior to the game the description visible on the screen is the following. Pay attention as to whether it says 'population' or 'area'!
