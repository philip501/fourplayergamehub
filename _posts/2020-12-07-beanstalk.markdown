The goal of this game is to climb up the beanstalk as high as possible within a certain time limit. This is achieved by jumping onto the next leaf by pressing one of your buttons accordingly. If the next leaf appears on the left side, press your left button, if the right, then press your right button. A misclick (meaning you jump to the wrong side of the beanstalk where there is no leaf) will result in falling straight down until you land on a leaf again.

The player who is on the highest level at the end of the timelimit wins the round. Your current level is visible right under your current score (see picture above). In the picture above, the current level would be '2', meaning you have successfully jumped on the first two leafs.
