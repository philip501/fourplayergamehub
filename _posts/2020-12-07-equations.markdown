The goal of this game is to press the button whenever the equation displayed on the screen on holds. This can either be a numbers equation (as can be seen in the picture above) or a formula. The fastest one to do so will be awarded a point and your button will be highlighted in green. In case a button is pressed and the name does not match the image you will lose a point and your button will be highlighted in red.

By default you have four seconds to recognise whether the equality holds true. This and other parameters (see list of customisable parameters below) can be customised.

Prior to the game the description visible on the screen is the following.
